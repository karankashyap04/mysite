    <ul>
        <li>Used transfer learning to design a computer vision based ML model to
            diagnose pneumonia patients using chest x-rays, and other CURB-65 data 
        </li>
        <li>Initial accuracy: ~95%</li>
        <li>Worked with an ENT specialist who used the tool as a source of second
            opinions in his practice
            <ul>
                <li>The ENT specialist praised the tool for its speed, accuracy, and
                    ease of use
                </li>
            </ul>

        <li>Received the Innovator Award from my high school for this project</li>
    </ul>

const mediumDescription = (
    <ul>
        <li>Authored articles on Medium, explaining concepts that span across disciplines
            like Computer Science, Matthematics and Machine Learning
        </li>
        <li>Author for 6 reputed online publications</li>
        <li>My articles have received 50,000+ views</li>

const researchpaperDescription = (
    <ul>
        <li>Authored a research paper which attempted to
            <em> Quantify the 'Deterioration' in the Performance of Image Classifying
                ML Models Under Whitebox Adversarial Attacks
            </em>
        </li>
    </ul>

const againstAmbiguityDescription = (
    <ul>
        <li>Wrote a book, <em>Against Ambiguity</em>, on ethical challenges in
            science, technology, economics, and society

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search Engine: </strong> Built a search engine by implementing
            the tf-idf algorithm, along with the pagerank algorithm.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rackette: </strong> Built a mini-compiler for the Racket
            progragramming language (built using ReasonML, another functional
            programming language)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Connect4: </strong> Built a Connect-4 bot that uses the minimax
                algorithm to compute the best move it can make (looking some number of
                moves into the future) whilst accounting for the fact that its opponent
                will also make the best moves available to them.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Decision Tree: </strong> Designed a system that creates a classification
                    decision tree (much like the decision tree that would be created if a set
                    of data were passed through a DecisionTree Classifier Machine Learning model)
